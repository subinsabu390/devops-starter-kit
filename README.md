## üß≠ Overview

This repository is intended as a boilerplate / starter kit for DevOps workflows.  
It demonstrates how to:

- Build a containerized application  
- Automate builds and image publishing with GitHub Actions  
- Deploy to Kubernetes (using manifests / Helm)  

You can clone or fork this repo, plug in your own credentials and cluster, and get a full DevOps pipeline working.

## ‚öô Features

- Sample web application (Python / Flask)  
- Dockerfile for containerization  
- GitHub Actions workflow: build ‚Üí push ‚Üí deploy  
- Kubernetes manifests: Deployment, Service, Ingress  
- Clear folder structure and documentation

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker  
- kubectl  
- A running Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud)  
- A container registry (e.g. Docker Hub)  

### Setup Secrets

Before the GitHub Actions pipeline will work, set up the following repository secrets:

| Secret Name         | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME`   | Your Docker Hub username                      |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD`   | Your Docker Hub password or access token      |
| `KUBE_CONFIG`       | Contents of your `~/.kube/config` or cluster kubeconfig |

> **Note:** You should configure all the secrets in your own repository settings.

### Clone & Run Locally (manual)

You can test locally without using GitHub Actions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subinsabu390/devops-starter-kit.git
cd devops-starter-kit

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t sample-app:latest .

# Run it locally
docker run -p 5000:5000 sample-app:latest
```

Then, if you have `kubectl` access to a cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

Your app should be deployed to Kubernetes.

### Using CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

1. Fork this repository (or clone & push to your own).  
2. Add the required secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, `KUBE_CONFIG`).  
3. Push to `main` branch (or open PR) ‚Äî the workflow will build, push, and deploy automatically.  
4. Check pipeline runs in **Actions** tab.

## üì¶ Deployment Details

- The **build step** uses Docker to containerize `app/`  
- The **push step** uploads to your registry with tag `latest` (and optionally commit SHA)  
- The **deploy step** uses `kubectl apply -f manifests/` to update your cluster  

By default, the manifests refer to the `:latest` image tag ‚Äî you can modify them or use versioned tagging in future enhancements.
